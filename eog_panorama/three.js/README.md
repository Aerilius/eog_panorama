Three.js on Bower
------

Package [three](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) on npm is suggested since Bower is lack of maintenance.

```bash
npm i --save three
```

Official repo: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#threejs
Official repo is too large on Bower, so I picked files out from that repo.

Current version: [r82](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r82).
In this repo the version in converted to `0.82.0` in semantic version for Bower to recognize.

### Usage

```bash
bower install --save three.js
```
